# Sales-Analytics-Power-BI
This BI Project involves tracking sales performance for a retail fashion chain in Germany using Power BI.

Business Problem
StyleScape relies on its monthly sales performance to gauge market traction and devise future strategies. However, the regional sales manager of its German division has been facing challenges in obtaining a clear and efficient view of sales performance due to data fragmentation, limited visual analytics, inconsistent performance metrics between reporting periods, and manual reporting (the reporting process is currently not automated).
To tackle this challenge, StyleScape hired Harley Analytics to implement a Power BI solution to implement a consistent data source, build a data model for the sales performance reports and automate the reporting process.

The objectives of the project is to create an automated sales dashboard for the sales department of stylescape which meets the following requirements:
1. Monthly Sales breakdown: Create an easy-to-use dashboard to visualize sales performance monthly, comparing it to the previous month.
2. Define KPIs: Identify the number of customers, sales growth month over month, profit trends month-over-month, average sales value, most profitable products etc.
3. Auto-update: Ensure that the dashboard is automatically updated every week.
